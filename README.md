# National-scale spatiotemporal variation in driver behaviour

'Understanding the complexities of human behaviour and movement are essential for advancements in various contexts, ranging from emergency services (Liu et al., 2022) to official statistics (Marchetti et al., 2016; Pappalardo et al., 2016). Traditional data collection methods, such as surveys, have been limited regarding collection frequency (Punzo et al., 2011). Though the use of mobile phones has been an invaluable source of data for studying movement behaviour, it does not offer the level of granularity provided by connected car data (Chen et al., 2019)' (Karikari et al., 2023)
